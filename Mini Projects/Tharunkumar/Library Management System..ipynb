    "Project Title: Library Management System\n",
    "\n",
    "Description: Develop a console-based library management system in Python. The system should be able to handle books and users, where users can borrow and return books.\n",
    "\n",
    "Features:\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables & User Input: The system should be able to take the user’s input for various functionalities like borrowing a book, returning a book, adding a new book, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Types: Use appropriate data types for different kinds of information. For example, use strings for book titles and author names, integers for book IDs, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type Conversions: Implement features where type conversions are necessary. For example, converting user input (which is usually a string) to other data types as necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Operators: Use Python operators for various computations and comparisons. For example, checking if a book is already borrowed or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional & Iterative Statements: Use these to control the flow of your program. For example, if a book is already borrowed, the system should not allow another user to borrow it until it’s returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strings: Book details like title, author, and publisher are strings. Implement features to search for books by title or author.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inbuilt Data Structures in Python: Use lists and dictionaries to store information about books and users.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions: Divide your code into functions, each performing a specific task like adding a new book, borrowing a book, returning a book, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "OOPS: Define classes for entities like Book and User with appropriate attributes and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Files: Store the data about books and users in files so that the information is not lost when you close the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exception Handling: Implement exception handling wherever necessary to prevent your program from crashing due to unexpected errors."
